# Nasa-Space-Apps-Challenge-21-Zeastellar
Zeastellar is developed to find the current profitability of the user's location. The Zeastellar finds whether the solar energy is suitable for that particular location or not. With its advanced ML model Zeastellar finds the cost of installation and profitability of the installation(Here profitability means Total cost of the electricity / cost of Solar UNit x 100). We have collected various data to evaluate the profitability. The data includes Total area of Installation, Solar Irradiation, Performance Ratio and ENergy Yield of the unit. With this Datas and some more algorithm, Zeastellar postulates a accuracy of 65%.
